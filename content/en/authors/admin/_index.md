Hello! I am SiHyeon Kim, a student in the Department of Computer Engineering at Jeonbuk National University. I enjoy breaking down problems structurally and verifying them through experimentation. I am very interested in improving user-perceived performance and stability based on data structures and algorithms. In team projects, I aim for clear issue management, code reviews, and automated testing/deployment (CI/CD). Currently, I am working on projects focused on [areas of interest: e.g., backend architecture, cloud operations, LLM utilization], and I aim to be a developer who consistently accumulates even small improvements.
